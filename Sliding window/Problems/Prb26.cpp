2348. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays

Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]
Output: 9
Explanation:
There are 5 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 3 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is 1 occurrence of [0,0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 3 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 9.



CODE :

        long long cnt=0;
        int left=0,zeros=0;
        for(int right=0;right<nums.size();right++){
            if(nums[right]==0){
                zeros++;
            }
            while((right-left+1)>zeros){
                if(nums[left]==0){
                    zeros--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            cnt+=zeros;

        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
